# Scientific Machine Learning — From First Principles

## Description
This repository is a **work-in-progress introduction to machine learning from a scientific and mathematical perspective**.  

The goal is to build core ML concepts starting from **optimization, linear algebra, probability, and dynamical systems**, with explicit connections to ideas familiar in physics, numerical modeling, and applied mathematics.

Rather than focusing on libraries or recipes, the emphasis is on:
- Understanding why algorithms work
- Deriving models and loss functions from first principles
- Implementing minimal, transparent examples

This repository will evolve toward **foundations needed for scientific machine learning**, including physics-informed methods and data-driven modeling of dynamical systems.

## Status
🚧 Early stage / under active development  

Content, structure, and scope will be refined iteratively as the repository evolves.
